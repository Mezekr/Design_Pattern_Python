 Design Patterns Tutorial with Python


 Proxy Design Pattern:
 - Proxy becomes handy when creating a highly resource-intensive object
 - Problem to solve
   - Postpone object creation unless absolutely necessary, due to the high-resource requirement of the object we're creating
- In the proxy design pattern, clients interact with a proxy object most of the time until the resource-intensive object becomes available. 
- The proxy object is in charge of creating the resource-intensive objects. 
- Adapter and Decorator are related to the proxy design pattern.
